# Blockchain-certify

Verifying documents authenticity is a tedious task, as involves a lot of communication mechanisms and protocols. For a certificate, or document to be verified after it is generated, the third party (or)person needs to contact the issuing body and verify its authenticity. This is a cumbersome task as it may involve multiple issuing organizations and stakeholders. We propose a blockchain based application or framework enter transactions in the blockchain network involving metadata regarding the generated document.
